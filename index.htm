                <p>
                    As a second year computer engineering co-op student, I've always been interested in the world of science and technology. 
                    I'm naturally just a really curious kid.  The first two years of my degree really helped me get a taste of what engineering life is like, and I've loved every step of the journey. 
                    I've learned many skills and collaborated with many talented individuals using agile methodology. 
                    Over the course of my degree I've really had to learn how to step up as a leader, and take control during certain group projects. 
                    I've learned how to use many development tools, such as Visual Studio, Atom, Sublime, and GitHub, and my curiosity alongside my eagerness to learn has helped me develop my proficiency in C and Java, and a working knowledge in C++, C#, Python, and Swift languages as well. 
                    What'll you'll see here is not only a collection of projects, but a progressive story as my journey to become a computer engineer continues.
